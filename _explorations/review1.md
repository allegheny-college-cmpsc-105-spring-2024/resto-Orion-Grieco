[Habesha Delights](https://allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2024.github.io/resto-naboni07/)

- After having eaten at Habesha Delights, I can say I am quite impressed. The richness of the Kitfo is remarkable; nothing I've eaten has come close. In fact, I've come up with a recipe in an attempt to re-create the godliness I've experienced today.

### Ingredients
- 1 ½ pounds beef fillet well-trimmed
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon anchovy paste
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/3 cup clarified butter or ghee

### Instructions
- Set out a large high-powered food processor. Make sure to trim all the silver skin and fat off the fillet and cut the fillet into large chunks. Place in the food processor.
- Add the cayenne, salt, anchovy paste, garlic powder, and cardamom. Pulse to chop the fillet into fine chunks. You can choose to stop with when the beef resembles ¼ inch chunks, or chop smaller into ground steak.
- Once the texture is to your liking, melt the clarified butter and pour over the top. Mix the butter in by hand, do not pulse.
- Serve raw immediately, cover and chill, or pan-fry over high heat for 1 -2 minutes.
