- After having eaten at Café Cocca, I can say I am quite impressed. There is an immense selection of beverages, all the way from Espresso to Matcha Lattés, to even having a wide variety of drink modifications beyond the already expansive selection. The food is great, the french toast is a wonderful eat for a breakfast dish, and the breakfast bagel is a splendid, scrumptious additional breakfast and brunch dish. I'll certainly be back for more.
