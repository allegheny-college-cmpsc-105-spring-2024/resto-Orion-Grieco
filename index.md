## <span style="color:teal">About Us</span>

>After opening our doors in 1925, we only had one mission; bring smiles to the families that walked through our doors. For nearly a century, we've prided ourselves on
>on using the most premier and highest-quality ingredients, some of which is even grown in our own gardens, with the rest being purchased from local farms. So far, we've never stopped short of producing Michelin-star quality dishes,
>and we've been rated #1 in Rome for almost 70 years in a row since 1955!
